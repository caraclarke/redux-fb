- store
  - rather than holding state in component state
  - state is held in redux store
  - empty object where we'll put all our information
- action
  - something that happens in your application (loads, clicks)
  - whenever that happens it dispatches an action
    - that action has the type of action
    - it has the payload of info (which photo got liked, comment got deleted)
    - information about what happened
  - action creators: returned object is the action, function is creator that dispatches it
- reducer
  - once an action is acted upon, how do I update the data
  - root reducer
- integrate store
- reducer and dispatching actions
- accessing dispatch and state with redux
- display/connect redux state to components
- update state with reducers
